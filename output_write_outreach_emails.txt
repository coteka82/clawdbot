Subject: How many patients is your family practice losing each month?

Hi Dr. Thompson,

Most family practices lose 15–20% of potential appointments to no-shows and missed follow-ups. For a busy practice in Austin, that can mean dozens of patients (and thousands in revenue) slipping through the cracks every month.

We built a quick **Clinic Efficiency Test** that shows you exactly what's happening in your practice — how many patients you're losing, where the gaps are, and what it's costing you.

It takes about 2 minutes. No sales pitch, just a clear snapshot of your clinic's efficiency.

Curious what your numbers look like?

Subject: Is phone chaos costing your urgent care patients?

Hi Dr. Chen,

Urgent care runs on speed — but when your front desk is drowning in calls, patients get busy signals, appointments get missed, and walk-ins pile up unpredictably.

We created a **Clinic Efficiency Test** for practices like yours. It takes 2 minutes and shows you:

→ How many patients you're losing to scheduling overload  
→ What no-shows are actually costing you  
→ Where the bottlenecks are hiding  

No fluff. Just real numbers based on your operation.

Subject: How many kids are missing follow-up appointments?

Hi Dr. Ruiz,

Pediatric practices have it tough — parents forget follow-ups, reschedule last-minute, or just don't pick up the phone. And every missed appointment means a child who isn't getting the care they need.

We built a simple **Clinic Efficiency Test** that shows you how many kids are falling through the cracks at your Houston practice — and what you could do to bring them back.

It's 2 minutes. No sales calls. Just a clear picture of where your scheduling and follow-ups are breaking down.

Worth a look?
